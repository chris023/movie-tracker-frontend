## Intro
Live: https://chris023.github.io/movie-tracker-frontend

This is a web app designed to organize and browser your personal media collections.  This was built for fun as a learning project and a demonstration of abilities.  The original project used a backend for login/registration and storing user favorites.  To run this locally without a server use the no-server branch.  If you wish to run the backend server as well, use the master branch and use the template at https://github.com/chris023/movie-tracker-backend.
